      "10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116287\n",
      "Thereby , pavements are quite suitable for solar energy utilization as energy , either electricity or heat , which can be generated with few cars or pedestrians shadowing the surface when solar radiation is strong .\n",
      "Meanwhile , pavements also have enormous potential to generate electricity .\n",
      "Besides , PV pavement was also found effective for heat island mitigation , decreasing the surface temperature and ambient temperature by 5 °C and about 1 °C , respectively [ 19 ] .\n",
      "Additionally , high module temperature will also accelerate the rate of aging [ 21 ] .\n",
      "Thereby , necessary measures should be taken to extract the surplus heat timely and keep the PV pavement in relatively low temperature .\n",

      "Therefore , in practice , a balance between the energy efficiency and the water temperature should be achieved considering specific requirements of users .\n",
      "Thereby , high transmissivity of the anti-slip layer dramatically contributes to high electrical efficiency , high thermal efficiency , and high temperature of the water in tank , which should be noticed when designing and manufacturing PIPVT modules .\n",
      "4.2.2 Weather parameters Both the electrical and thermal energy are transformed from solar radiation , which is thus an essential factor to impact the performance of the PIPVT system .\n",
      "Thus , high ambient temperature is beneficial to generating more thermal energy and obtaining warmer water at the cost of an inapparent decrease of electricity generated .\n",
      "In summary , the significant improvement of thermal and PES efficiency could be achieved through increasing solar radiation and ambient temperature at the expense of a slight decrease of electrical efficiency .\n",
      "The aforementioned results reveal that the PIPVT module still has potential to generate more energy if the energy losses could be reduced .\n",
      "b ) The significant improvement of overall system performance could be achieved through increasing transmissivity of anti-slip layer , solar radiation and ambient temperature , estimated on primary energy saving ( PES ) efficiency .\n",

      "To ensure the sufficient structural integrity , we studied the wind uplift , creep performance and durability of the adhesives ( Honeker et al. , 2016 ) .\n",
      "In addition , since a typical roof accounts for about 14 % of the total cooling loads in a residential building ( Buildings Energy Databook , 2010 ) , the potential for heat build-up caused by adhesive-mounted rooftop PV may increase the cooling demand of the building .\n",

      "Lamnatou and Chemisana ( 2014 ) examined the life-cycle performance of a GRIPV roof relative to a PV-gravel roof , a GR , and a gravel roof , and found material production to be the most energy-intense process , concluding that GRIPV roofing was a viable option with multiple benefits , confirming the significance of building materials , as discovered by previous research .\n",
      "4 A lack of research was also observed in the literature in terms of analyzing the potential long-term impacts of ARSs while also taking into account the internal and external dynamics of the applications of these systems , as well as how these dynamics might affect their overall long-term benefits .\n",
      "5 Several studies point out the need for further research on the integration of green and PV roofs ( Brudermann and Sangkakool , 2017 ) and for effective policy options that will encourage the use of alternative roofing systems ( Jean et al. , 2015 ; Schindler et al. , 2016 ) .\n",
      "1.2 The objective of the study Although ARSs are able to help mitigate urban environmental concerns and support urban sustainability , the application ( i.e . market shares ) of these systems is still relatively marginal in Orlando and in the U.S. overall ( Chemisana and Lamnatou , 2014 ) .\n",
      "Thus , the environmental concerns that the ARS industry seeks to address continue to contribute to significant environmental and socioeconomic problems on a long-term , macro-level scale .\n",
      "The long-term impacts of these hindrances on the ARS market must be properly analyzed and addressed in order to contribute to developing an optimum solution with which to lessen these impacts and promote more effective growth in the ARS market .\n",

      "1 Problem/Hypothesis Identification : Despite the proven potential of alternative roofing systems to significantly reduce urban runoff , the UHI effect , energy consumption , and GHG emissions , their long-term impacts and overall potential with respect to their market penetration and sustainability benefits must be covered by the system boundary as they apply to Orlando ’ s alternative roofing market .\n",
      "5 Validation : Various tests are applied to validate the model in order to confirm that it serves as a reasonably accurate depiction of the modeled system in reality .\n",
      "Alternative roof adoption strategies for new roofing construction will also be essential , among other possible policy initiatives .\n",
      "3.1.2 Green roof market Green roof market penetration demonstrated potential for future growth , with 2040 green roof market shares increasing by as much as 149 % ( compared to the BAU scenario ) with sufficient investment in Orlando ’ s green roof market , as shown in Fig . 3b .\n",
      "3.1.3 Solar roof market The solar roofing industry is the most mature out of the three alternative roofing markets considered in this study , and consequently has the most potential for future market penetration , as shown in Fig . 3c .\n",
      "However , as shown in Fig . 4 , the GRIPV market , once introduced and given sufficient policy support , has significant market penetration potential , enough to surpass green roofing under some policy scenarios ( e.g . Green2+Solar2+GRIPV ) .\n",
      "However , urban runoff results at the building level – specifically a comparison of the individual performances of each alternative roofing option – imply the potential for more optimistic results if green/GRIPV roofing technology can achieve further growth and development beyond what was simulated in this study , as shown in Fig . 5 and provided in Section S1.7 .\n",
      "3.1.6 The UHI effect The simulation results indicate significantly more potential for improvement with respect to the UHI effect in Orlando as opposed to the urban runoff results .\n",
      "The “ Solar2+GRIPV ” scenario demonstrates the best numerical results in this regard , indicating that solar and GRIPV roofing will be especially effective at reducing the UHI effect .\n",
      "However , the UHI effect results at the building level imply the potential for far more optimistic results if green/GRIPV roofing technology can achieve further growth and development beyond what was simulated in this study , as provided in Section S1.7 and Fig . 6 .\n",
      "This is because solar and GRIPV roofing options can both actively generate electricity via solar PV technology to offset energy requirements and provide the passive cooling benefits previously discussed with respect to the UHI effect , whereas green roofs can only passively reduce energy demand by reducing the need for air conditioning and other forms of cooling .\n",
      "The maximum possible goal contribution in this regard was found to be only 4.13 % of the established per-capita energy savings goal by 2040 , though this was a 546 % improvement compared to the BAU scenario and a 488 % improvement compared to the GRIPV-only ( “ BAU + GRIPV ” ) scenario .\n",
      "This indicates a 546 % improvement compared to the BAU scenario and a 488 % improvement compared to the GRIPV-only scenario .\n",
      "3.2.3 Solar roof market As shown in Figs . 11a and 11b , the uncertainty results for the solar PV/BIPV roof market showed its potential to achieve market penetration levels as high as 3,000–3,840 acres ( 12 – 14 km2 ) by the year 2040 under optimal BAU or GRIPV-only market conditions .\n",
      "These uncertainty results indicate that , with further attention to market conditions as needed , solar PV/BIPV roofing can become a more competitive roofing option in Orlando than what was previously observed in the policy analysis results , without being as heavily dependent on external policy support as the green or GRIPV markets might be .\n",
      "Like the green roof market , the GRIPV roof market demonstrated little sensitivity to external market influences .\n",
      "Although continued policy support for green and GRIPV roofing in Orlando will be a crucial first step to encouraging more pervious urban building materials and thus reducing urban runoff more significantly in the future , the policy analysis results have already shown that further policy intervention will also be necessary for this purpose ( Fig . 11 ) .\n",
      "Furthermore , these findings indicate that urban runoff in Orlando is unlikely to decrease on a citywide scale in the near future despite the clear effectiveness of green/GRIPV roofing for reducing runoff on a building scale , as also shown in Fig . 5 .\n",
      "This high degree of variability indicates that the UHI effect in Orlando will depend more on future technological and practical development in the urban roofing industry as a whole than on the policy support of one or more particular roofing options without such development .\n",
      "However , since green and GRIPV roofing are significantly more effective in this regard on an individual scale , as also shown Fig . 6 , it is possible for the green and GRIPV roofing industries to play a larger role in counteracting the UHI effect in the future if they can achieve sufficient market growth .\n",
      "These results indicate that greater contributions toward the established 2040 energy savings are more likely to depend on future technological and practical development in the urban roofing industry as a whole than on the policy support of one or more particular roofing options without such development .\n",
      "Among the studied roofing alternatives , the solar roofing market is expected to maintain its relative dominance in the alternative roofing industry and has the most potential for future growth .\n",
      "In contrast , the green and GRIPV roof markets , despite also demonstrating significant potential for future market growth , are far more static in terms of their gross investment costs ( excluding available savings and incentives ) and practical feasibility .\n",
      "Therefore , policy support and further technological development for green roofing and the green roof components of GRIPV roofs will both be essential in the future , as also concluded by Berto et al . ( 2018 ) .\n",
      "However , based on the simulation results , it is possible to mention some intrinsic improvements that could be developed to foster the alternative roofing market as the followings ; • Shifting toward more lightweight and/or more user-friendly green roof designs , e.g . modular GR systems .\n",
      "This holds true given a sufficient combination of policy initiatives and future industrial and technological enhancement for the alternative roofing industry as a whole .\n",
      "However , ARSs – particularly GR systems – at the building level yield significant improvements .\n",
      "Nevertheless , it can be concluded that the green and GRIPV roof markets have more potential to reduce the UHI effect , particularly with the introduction of GRIPV roofing .\n",
      "Therefore , although policy support for alternative roofing will be important in the future , further technological and market development will be essential to further reduce the UHI effect .\n",
      "Nevertheless , continuing to invest in market growth and future development for GRs – particularly GR modules with greater carbon sequestration potential ( e.g . semi-intensive and intensive green roofs ) – will continue to be crucial to reducing energy demand and GHG emissions in the future .\n",
      "5 Limitations and future remarks Due to the relatively generalized nature of the developed model and of this study as a whole , several factors were not considered that might limit the study ’ s ability to provide further insights .\n",
      "Although the behaviors of these outputs was still found to be reasonably accurate based on available information on their real-world counterparts , more historical data on all five of these parameters would be very helpful to validate future models in which they are featured .\n",
      "Likewise , additional policy efforts could potentially target one or more of these factors ( esp .\n",
      "in urban runoff and the UHI effect ) , but these additional policy initiatives were beyond the scope of this study and were therefore excluded .\n",
      "However , there are still significant obstacles in today ’ s alternative roofing ( AR ) industry , and the extent to which these obstacles hinder the long-term market penetration of ARSs is not yet fully understood .\n",
      "There are several constraints restricting the market growth ( or diffusion ) of ARSs and thus hindering their overall potential to address these problems , and Brudermann and Sangkakool ( 2017 ) identified the following three major hindrances to ARS adoption based on interviews with academic , industrial , and sociopolitical green roof experts : • Political constraints , • Skepticism of potential adopters , and • Lack of knowledge ( esp .\n",
      "Therefore , alternative roofing for new building construction was not taken into account .\n",
      "Also , the green roof market was found to be very resilient to adverse market conditions , with its 2040 market shares never decreasing by more than 5.4 % relative to the BAU scenario .\n",
      "Although green roof market shares have been found to never exceed those of the solar roof market in any of the tested policy scenarios , the findings indicate that the green roof market can still potentially thrive with more diverse investment portfolios in the alternative roofing industry as a whole .\n",
      "Nevertheless , this decrease was noticeably less drastic in some scenarios in which both alternatives received policy support ( e.g . the “ Green2+Solar2+GRIPV ” scenario ) , while some multiple-policy scenarios ( e.g . the “ Green1+Solar2+GRIPV ” scenario ) still demonstrated a net increase in 2040 solar roof market penetration compared to that of the BAU scenario , meaning that a balanced policy solution can still be found without significantly compromising the future of Orlando ’ s solar roof industry .\n",
      "Overall , though the market share of GRIPV roofing is still likely to remain marginal compared to that of conventional roofing , it shows to be a promising alternative in Orlando .\n",
      "Nevertheless , this limited potential for future growth under a BAU policy scenario clearly indicates that the green roof market can not rely on chance alone with regard to the market/technological conditions considered in the uncertainty analysis ( see Section S1.6.2 and Tables S74-S75 ) , and that the future growth and development of Orlando ’ s green roof market will depend heavily on economic , educational , and technological policies and development initiatives , among other possible future efforts .\n",
      "This means that , once introduced , the GRIPV roof market can not rely on chance alone with regard to the market/technological conditions considered in the uncertainty analysis ( see Section S1.6.2 and Tables S74-S75 ) , but will instead require significant educational , economic , and practical policy investments and development initiatives to support its future growth .\n",
      "In other words , although more significant contributions to the established 2040 GHG emission savings goals are possible in the alternative roofing industry with technological development ( e.g . solar PV efficiency , cooling load reductions , and carbon sequestration mechanisms ) , the need for future policy support and other GHG emission-reducing initiatives should not be overlooked .\n",
      "The alternative roofing market is therefore unlikely to achieve any significant level of market penetration through standard “ retrofitting ” adoption strategies alone .\n",
      "• As GR and GRIPV systems have been found to show a limited contractor experience relative to solar roof system , improving contractor training initiatives with green and GRIPV roofing and shifting toward simpler , lower-maintenance green roof designs that are easier for contractors to install/maintain is another venue in this regard .\n",
      "On the other hand , the green and GRIPV roof markets are more heavily limited with respect to their contributions to the UHI reduction due to their much smaller market penetration , especially when only retrofitting adoption process are considered .\n",
      "In short , although it would still not be prudent to rely solely on the alternative roofing market to meet these goals , policy support and technological/market development in this regard can still be of great benefit .\n",
      "Moreover , insufficient surface temperature data was available to use the surface temperature anomaly as a valid reference for the UHI effect .\n",

      "In order to enhance the service life ( which is critical for this application ) several authors [ 19 ] used PPy nano-leaves serving as backbone and conductive shortened conductive paths among Ni ( OH ) 2 nano leaves .\n",
      "The last step for finishing the supercapacitor includes closing empty spaces as much as possible with a stable electrolyte with good conductivity .\n",

      "We argue that an accurate integration of roof heat fluxes in the solar energy assessment is an important step to reduce the uncertainty around the benefit of sustainable coatings on the PV energy yield , supporting the development and dissemination of these technologies , as well as , approaches to decarbonize the building energy system to achieve the goal of climate neutrality ( e.g. , as in [ 30,31 ] ) .\n",
      "Although it is difficult to reduce errors due to variability in rain and cloud cover , a longer measurement period for calibration could potentially improve the model error .\n",
      "In summer , sustainable roofs could reduce outdoor temperature in proximity to the roof and stabilize indoor temperature due to improved building insulation [ 58 ] .\n",
      "However , simulation models should be used in these regions to confirm this hypothesis , as the cooling potential of green roofs is often questioned in warm and dry climates , since the required irrigation energy demand could compensate the PV energy yield increase [ 59 ] .\n",
      "Considering that the rooftop PV energy capacity is predicted to grow in the future [ 62 ] , these energy yield improvements could potentially increase the share of electricity generated from renewables , which is an important step to achieve the goal of climate neutrality [ 63 ] .\n",
      "Given these multifunctional benefits , it is likely that sustainable roofs will prove cost-effective as replacements for traditional roofs ; however , integrated assessments that evaluate the environmental and economic potential of sustainable roofs are still needed to determine whether green roofs or cool roofs would be the preferred rooftop choice .\n",
      "Cool roofs outperform green roofs for PV energy yield ; however , potential improvements of both systems are non-negligible , even in relatively cooler climate regions like Switzerland .\n",
      "It is clear that variations in certain roof parameters can considerably alter the PV yield and thus knowledge of these parameters will improve the accuracy of simulations .\n",
      "• The PV panel yield is most sensitive to the roof albedo , shading and thickness , demonstrating that optimizing these parameters on sustainable roofs could considerably augment their benefits .\n",
      "The simplified energy balance model could be improved with more complex models available in the literature ( e.g. , [ 3,41,77 ] ) that directly consider additional green roof properties , such as soil moisture content , leaf area index and stomatal resistance .\n",
      "Future work should incorporate these findings with other multi-functional benefits of sustainable roofing configurations , including : urban heat mitigation , building energy savings , stormwater attenuation , and biodiversity enhancement .\n",

      "Therefore , it can be concluded that integrating semi-transparent OPV on the greenhouse roof could fulfill net-zero energy greenhouses to provide the significant potential for high production , environmental-friendly agriculture .\n",
      "All in all , it is expected that OPV is becoming an excellent shading material on the greenhouse roof practically in the future due to various benefits of OPV , one of the best properties of OPV is that varying active layer absorption spectrum ( corresponds to band gap ) by material selection .\n",

      "Because flip-flops are popular and commonly worn in wet environments , which may additionally result in water being present at the interface between the foot and flip-flop footbed , these findings have important practical applications ; greater slip velocity and relative motion would indicate greater slip severity and decreased potential for slip recovery , leading to greater likelihood of a fall and potential for injury .\n",
      "In consideration of the factors described here , while the methodology employed was valuable to evaluate slip kinematics via a controlled method of provocation , it is possible that to improve fidelity in future work it may be beneficial to use alternative methods to replicate such characteristics as foot inclination angle , vertical force , and PV during slipping in flip-flops occurring during gait or stair descent , and consider alternative measures and methods to quantify relative foot—flip-flop motion .\n",

      "To reduce the frequency of false positive alarms from the thermal protection system , recent efforts have been invested in the characterisation of appearance , and cataloguing hotspots in the field of view of the protection cameras [ 11 ] .\n",
      "As mentioned above , the activity of the hot spots is caused by plasma-wall interaction , i.e . a hot spot becomes active when there is sufficient heat flux from the plasma towards the plasma-facing surface .\n",
      "Thus , in each pulse we observe : • good time : total time in which the outer strike point was within the defined activation area , and the NBI heating power was above the minimum value , • hot time : the total time of hot spot activity within the good time intervals The combined good and hot times are shown for the hot spots on tiles 6 and 7 , detected at threshold value of 250 are shown in Fig . 10 a and 10b respectively .\n",

      "Beyond that , the analysis of the activity of the hot spots during a running campaign can be used to help to identify potential hot spots before they evolve to the point of prematurely terminating pulses by causing high temperature alarms , while the identified plasma parameter values can serve as input data for shaping future discharges to avoid further degradation of the divertor surfaces .\n",
      "Defining the activation areas and minimum required NBI power for the activity of the hot spots makes it possible to distinguish whether the observed gradual increase in the hot spot activity was caused by gradually increasing powers deposited on unchanging plasma facing components , or was in indeed caused by changes on the surface .\n",
      "The activity of the first group roughly followed the trends of the good time , while the second group , by definition , did not show any activity prior to JPN 86,000 .\n",
